# Leaf

Leaf is a templating language that integrates with Futures, Reactive Streams and Codable. This section outlines how to import the Leaf package into a Vapor project.

## Adding Leaf to your project

The easiest way to use Leaf with Vapor is to include the Leaf repository as a dependency in Package.swift:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "project1",
    dependencies: [
        // ðŸ’§ A server-side Swift web framework.
        .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/vapor.git", .branch("beta")),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/leaf.git", .branch("beta")),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "App",
            dependencies: ["Vapor", "Leaf"]
        ),
        .target(name: "Run", dependencies: ["App"]),
        .testTarget(name: "AppTests", dependencies: ["App"]),
    ]
)
```

The Leaf package adds Leaf to your project, but to configure it for use you must modify configure.swift:

1. Add `import Leaf` to the top of the file so that Leaf is available to use. You will also need to add this to any file that will render templates.
2. Add `try services.register(LeafProvider())` to the `configure()` function so that routes may render Leaf templates as needed.


## Syntax Highlighting

You may also wish to install one of these third-party packages that provide support for syntax highlighting in Leaf templates.

### Atom

### Xcode

It is not currently possible to implement Leaf Syntax Highlighting in Xcode, however, using Xcode's HTML Syntax Coloring can help a bit. Select one or more Leaf files and then choose Editor > Syntax Coloring > HTML.  Your selected Leaf files will now use Xcode's HTML Syntax Coloring.  Unfortunately the usefulness of this is limited because this association will be removed when `vapor xcode` is run.

There appears to be a way to [make Xcode file associations persist](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9050035/how-to-make-xcode-recognize-a-custom-file-extension-as-objective-c-for-syntax-hi) but that requires a bit more kung-fu.

### CLion & AppCode

Some preliminary work has been done to implement a Leaf Plugin for CLion & AppCode but lack of skill and interest in Java has slowed progress! If you have IntelliJ SDK experience and want to help with this, message Tom Holland on [Vapor Slack](http://vapor.team)
